Def. Group
	A group is a set G with a binary function * : G x G -> G satisfying the following
	axioms: (CIIA)

	C: (Closure) For any element g and h in G, the result g * h is also in G

	I: (Identity) There is an element e in G such that, for all g in G, e * g = g
	and g * e = g

	I: (Inverses) For each g in G, there is an element of G denoted g^-1 that 
	satisfies g * g^-1 = e and g^-1 = e

	A: (Associativity) FOr any elements g, h and j in G, we have (g * h) * j =
	g * (h * j)

Def. Dihedral Group | Dn
	A dihedral group is the set of symmetries of a regular n-gon.

	Ex: The set of symmetries of an equilateral triangle.

Def. Symmetric Group | Sn
	A symmetric group is the set of permutations of n distinct sequential 
	integers. {1, 2, ... n} under the operation of composition.

Def. Cyclic Group | Zn
	A cyclic group has {0, 1, .. n-1}  has it's elements and addition mod n
	as it's binary operation

Def. Order of the element
	The order of the element, k, is the smallest k such that g^k = e. 
	If there is no such positive integer k then we say g has infinite order.

	Ex: in D3 the group of symmetries of an equilateral triangle, a reflection
	r has order 2, because r^2 = 3.

	The group identity itself always has order 1, because e^1 = e.

Def. Group Isomorphism
	An isomorphism between two groups is a bijective map preserving the group
	operations.

	Ex: Consider the symmetries of the letter I and pair of integers mod 2. 
	Also the mapping F(I) = (0, 0), F(H) = (1, 0), F(V) = (0, 1) and F(R) = (1, 1).
	Where I means identity; H, horizontal reflection; V, vertical,; R, rotation.
	Here the G1 = {I, H, V, R} and * means composition.
	While G2 = {(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1)}, and * means addition mod 2.

	For instance: I * H = H, and ((0, 0) + (1, 0)) % 2 = (1, 0).
	And more interestingly: H * R = V, while ((1, 0) + (1, 1)) % 2 = (0, 1).
